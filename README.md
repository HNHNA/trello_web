Description:

The Trello Clone project is a web application developed to mimic the functionality of the popular project management tool, Trello. The goal of the project was to recreate key features of Trello, allowing users to create boards, lists, and cards to organize tasks and collaborate with team members effectively.

Key Features:

Board Creation and Management: Users can create multiple boards to organize different projects or tasks.

List and Card Management: Within each board, users can create lists to represent different stages of their workflow (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done). They can then add cards to these lists, representing individual tasks or items to be completed.

Drag-and-Drop Functionality: Implemented drag-and-drop functionality to enable users to easily move cards between lists, updating their status and position dynamically.

User Authentication and Authorization: Implemented user authentication and authorization functionalities to ensure secure access to boards and data. Users can sign up for an account, log in securely, and manage their boards.

Dark and Light Mode: Adds the function of switching between night and day modes, allowing users to customize the interface to suit personal preferences and reduce eye strain when working in bright conditions weak or in the dark of night.

Real-time Collaboration: Utilized WebSocket technology to enable real-time collaboration, allowing multiple users to view and update boards simultaneously.

Responsive Design: Ensured the application is responsive and mobile-friendly, allowing users to access and manage their boards and tasks from various devices.

Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB

Outcome:

The Trello Clone project provided hands-on experience in building a full-stack web application using modern frontend and backend technologies. It enhanced my understanding of ReactJS, state management, RESTful APIs, and real-time communication. Additionally, it showcased my ability to design and implement user-friendly interfaces and effectively collaborate within a team environment.
